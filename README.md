- June temperatures range from low of 64 to high of 85 degF, whereas December temperatures range from low of 56 to a high of 83 degF.
- June average temperature is 75 degF, where as December average temperature is 71 degF.
- During June & December 50% of the time temperatures are above their average of 75 & 71 degF respectively.
- The standard deviation for December is much higher then June which means that during the month of December temperatures are more spread out than in June.

## Summary

The temperature in December is close enough to the temperature of June that it will be suitable to run a surf shop and ice cream shop during the month of December in Oahu, HI.

Some recommendations for further analysis maybe: 
- To review the success of similar surf shop & ice cream shops in the area during these same months.
- To show a map of where other competitor surf shop's are located, the hours of operation, their weeks of operation, years of business, and relevant location to the ocean.

I believe further analysis on some of the above recommendations will better position the surf shop for the investors reassurance of future success here.
